//! Per-consumer state machine.

//! Mirrors `org.apache.pulsar.client.impl.ConsumerImpl`. Responsibilities:
//!
//! - Bounded receiver queue (`max_receiver_queue_size`).
//! - Permit accounting → emit `CommandFlow` when the receiver queue drains below the threshold.
//! - Batch explosion: a `CommandMessage` carrying `num_messages_in_batch > 1` is split into one
//!   [`IncomingMessage`] per position the broker still lists as unacked in
//!   [`pb::CommandMessage::ack_set`], each with `batch_index` set. A first dispatch carries no
//!   `ack_set` and therefore surfaces all N; a re-dispatch of a partially-acked entry surfaces only
//!   the positions that still owe an acknowledgement (ADR-0105, issue #436).
//! - Chunk reassembly: messages with `num_chunks_from_msg > 1` are buffered until all chunks
//!   arrive, then surfaced as one logical message.
//! - Dead-letter routing: when redelivery count exceeds `max_redeliver_count`, the consumer records
//!   the message id; the runtime crate is expected to publish to the DLQ topic via a sibling
//!   Producer.
//! - Seek: emits `CommandSeek`, freezes the queue until `CommandAckResponse`.
