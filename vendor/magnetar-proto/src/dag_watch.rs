//! PIP-460 scalable-topic watch-session state machine (sans-io).
//!
//! **Experimental** (PIP-460, ADR-0093). A [`DagWatchSession`] tracks the
//! current segment DAG for one scalable topic and applies broker-pushed
//! [`pb::CommandScalableTopicUpdate`] frames against it. The session is pure
//! state — no I/O, no clock — matching the
//! [ADR-0004](https://github.com/CleverCloud/magnetar/blob/main/specs/adr/0004-sans-io-protocol-core.md)
//! sans-io contract. The runtime engines drive it from inside their
//! connection lock and translate the returned [`DagDelta`] into
//! [`ConnectionEvent`](crate::ConnectionEvent) variants.
//!
//! # One session, no separate subscribe
//!
//! Upstream has no distinct DAG-watch handshake. `CommandScalableTopicLookup`
//! carries a client-allocated `session_id` and **is** the subscribe;
//! `CommandScalableTopicUpdate` is the reply to it *and* every subsequent
//! pushed update; `CommandScalableTopicClose` ends it. So a session here is
//! created empty by the lookup and populated by the first update, rather than
//! being seeded from a lookup response and then subscribed separately.
//!
//! # Snapshots, not deltas
//!
//! Each update carries a **whole** [`pb::ScalableTopicDag`] stamped with a
//! monotonic `epoch`; there are no split / merge event frames on the wire. The
//! session replaces its layout wholesale and derives what changed by diffing
//! the old and new segment sets, reading split / merge structure off the
//! `parent_ids` / `child_ids` edges of the incoming layout. A frame whose
//! epoch does not advance is **ignored** — it is a re-sent snapshot the
//! session already holds, and Pulsar 5.0.0-M1 sends one routinely — so it
//! neither mutates state nor ends the session.
//!
//! # Drop-on-change
//!
//! Per ADR-0093, carried forward by ADR-0093, the surface is **observation +
//! drop-on-change**: the session records the layout, applies updates, and
//! reports what changed, but does not perform transparent segment failover.
//! The runtime closes the per-segment consumers and surfaces a
//! `DagChangedDuringConsume` event when a split / merge / removal lands while a
//! `StreamConsumer` is active. Transparent failover and in-place repartition
//! are explicit future work.
