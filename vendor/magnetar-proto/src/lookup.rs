//! Binary-protocol topic lookup state machine.
//!
//! Port of `org.apache.pulsar.client.impl.BinaryProtoLookupService`. We model
//! the lookup as a tiny per-request state machine that translates one
//! `CommandLookupTopicResponse` into one terminal [`LookupOutcome`].
//!
//! Each lookup resolves to exactly one of three terminal [`LookupOutcome`]s.
//!
//! [`LookupOutcome::Connect`] — the topic resolved to a broker; the engine routes the data ops
//! there.
//!
//! [`LookupOutcome::Redirected`] — the broker is not the bundle owner and redirected us to a
//! different broker. Per ADR-0004 the sans-io core must not dial a socket, so it does **not** chase
//! the redirect itself: it surfaces the redirect target plus the next-hop `authoritative` flag plus
//! the remaining hop budget, and the **engine** dials that target broker (reusing its per-broker
//! connection pool) and re-issues the lookup there via [`crate::Connection::lookup_redirect`]. This
//! mirrors Java `BinaryProtoLookupService#findBroker`, which recurses on
//! `client.getCnxPool().getConnection(redirectAddress)` (`BinaryProtoLookupService.java:182`,
//! `:207`). The chase used to run inside this crate (re-encoding `CommandLookupTopic` on the same
//! socket), which silently re-asked a non-owner broker and looped to the cap on a multi-broker
//! cluster; the engine-driven dial fixes that.
//!
//! [`LookupOutcome::Failed`] — the lookup failed, including the synthetic `Failed` raised when a
//! redirect chain exhausts [`MAX_LOOKUP_REDIRECTS`].
//!
//! The redirect cap is enforced in two cooperating places: the translate layer
//! short-circuits a `Redirect` to [`LookupOutcome::Failed`] once
//! `hops_remaining == 0` (the hard floor), and
//! [`crate::Connection::lookup_redirect`] clamps the engine-supplied budget to
//! [`MAX_LOOKUP_REDIRECTS`] on every re-entry so a buggy engine cannot exceed
//! the cap.
