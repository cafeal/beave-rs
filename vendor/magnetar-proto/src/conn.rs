//! The central `Connection` sans-io state machine.

//! Public surface mirrors `quinn-proto::Connection`:
//!
//! - [`Connection::handle_bytes`] takes inbound bytes and updates internal state.
//! - [`Connection::poll_transmit`] drains queued outbound bytes.
//! - [`Connection::poll_event`] yields semantic [`ConnectionEvent`]s.
//! - [`Connection::poll_timeout`] / [`Connection::handle_timeout`] drive keepalives + trackers.

//! On top of that, a handle-based façade lets callers (the runtime crate) open producers /

    /// master `:2037-2044`. (Its sibling branches are not no-ops: a still-pending creation
    /// gets `ServiceNotReady`, an exceptionally-completed one a mapped error.)
    ///
    /// So the pre-ADR-0108 shape — zero the mirrors, re-`CommandSubscribe` the live id,
    /// re-grant a full `receiver_queue_size` window on the `Success` — did the opposite of
    /// what it documented: the broker kept its slot and its permit balance untouched and
    /// then took a SECOND full window it had never agreed to, once per attempt, while the
    /// wedge it was called to clear could not move.
    ///
    /// # The two phases
    ///
    /// 1. emit `CommandCloseConsumer` for this id, registered as
    ///    `PendingRequestKind::ConsumerCloseForReattach`. The client slot is deliberately NOT
    ///    marked closed — this consumer is being repaired, not retired — and no ack tracker is
    ///    flushed, so nothing about the caller-visible consumer changes yet;
    /// 2. on that close's `Success`, and only then, `complete_consumer_close_for_reattach` zeroes
    ///    the permit mirrors, drops any open stall window, fails every in-flight ack (issue #346)
    ///    and re-emits `CommandSubscribe` with the initial `CommandFlow` deferred to ITS `Success`.
    ///
    /// Deferring every mutation to phase 2 is what makes a rejected close harmless: the
    /// broker still holds the consumer exactly as it was, so the client's mirrors must
    /// still describe it. Zeroing them up front would leave a consumer we failed to close
    /// with `permit_balance == 0`, which is strictly worse than the stall it was in —
    /// `is_stall_candidate` requires `permit_balance > 0`, so it would be wedged AND
    /// undetectable.
    ///
    /// # Refusals
    ///

    /// was never subscribed, is user-closed, unsubscribing, terminal, mid-seek (the seek's
    /// own [`Self::resubscribe_consumer_after_seek`] owns re-attach), already re-attaching
    /// (`flow_on_subscribe_ack`), already has a close-for-re-attach in flight, or is one of
    /// the two shapes this recovery must not apply to:
    ///
    /// - **`Failover`** — the close really detaches this consumer, so the broker runs an election.
    ///   An active consumer would hand its partition to a standby and come back at the end of the
    ///   priority order; a standby's re-attach re-enters that order. That is a subscription-wide
    ///   reshuffle to repair one slot, and the caller asked for a repair, not a failover.
    /// - **non-durable** — a non-durable subscription's cursor lives only as long as the consumer.
    ///   Closing it discards that cursor, and the re-attach restarts from the subscribe request's
    ///   `start_message_id` (ADR-0099), silently skipping or replaying the backlog. There is no
    ///   in-place repair for a cursor the close destroys.
    ///
    /// Both refusals are made HERE rather than in
    /// `consumer_reattach_in_place_is_eligible`, which is shared with issue #307's
    /// broker-initiated `CommandCloseConsumer` arm and with phase 2's own re-attach: there
    /// the broker has ALREADY closed the consumer, so refusing a Failover standby or a
